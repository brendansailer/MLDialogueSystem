# Directory for the images created by the generate_heatmap script

Please check out each sub-directory here individually starting with the simple model then the sentence model.

The sentence model has more details on each image since it is more interesting as the context is more complex.

These images were helpful in determining the number of epochs to train.
- The simple model was best after 11 epochs.
- For the sentence model, the amount of epochs varied because the model became overfit quickly.
- Going foward, adding more rows of data to train the sentence model would likely yield significant improvements.
