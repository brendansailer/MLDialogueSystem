NOTE: .txt files that match the .h5 file is the data from the training script.  This is useful to determine the proper number of epochs

Data about old models:
qa_g_lstm.h5 - 50 Epochs on the 3 starter questions.  Use questionsCreation.py to create contexts with just 3 fields.
qa_g_lstm_context_increased.h5 - 50 Epochs on the 3 starter questions.  Use txtCreation.py to create contexts with 5 fields
qa_g_lstm_context_increased_11.h5 - 11 Epochs on the 3 starter questions.  Use txtCreation.py to create contexts with 5 fields
